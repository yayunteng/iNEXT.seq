`iNEXT.seq` (iNterpolation and EXTrapolation for UniFrac distance) is an R package. In this document, we provide a quick introduction demonstrating how to run `iNEXT.seq`. Detailed information about `iNEXT.seq` functions is provided in the iNEXT.seq manual, also available in [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=iNEXT.seq). An online version of [iNEXT.seq-online](http://chao.stat.nthu.edu.tw/wordpress/software_download/iNEXT.seq-online/) is also available for users without an R background.

`iNEXT.seq` provides a new way to measure UniFrac distance, by applying dissimilarity measures based on Chiu's et al.'s multiple assemblages decomposition (Chiu, Jost, and Chao (2014)). And we mainly consider three measures of Hill numbers of order q: species richness (`q = 0`), Shannon diversity (`q = 1`, the exponential of Shannon entropy) and Simpson diversity (`q = 2`, the inverse of Simpson concentration).

`iNEXT.seq` uses the observed sample of OTU count data (called the "reference sample") 
to calculate UniFrac distance estimates and the associated confidence intervals for coverage-based rarefaction and extrapolation (R/E) curve.

`iNEXT.seq` computes dissimilarity as UniFrac distance estimates by doing monotonic transformation on phylogenetic beta diversity for rarefied and extrapolated samples, based on standardized levels of sample completeness (measured by sample coverage). This coverage-based  sampling curve plots the diversity estimates with respect to sample coverage. 


## HOW TO CITE iNEXT.seq
If you publish your work based on the results from the `iNEXT.seq` package, you should make references to the following methodology paper:

## SOFTWARE NEEDED TO RUN iNEXT.seq IN R
- Required: [R](https://cran.r-project.org/)
- Suggested: [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/#Desktop)


## HOW TO RUN iNEXT.seq:
The `iNEXT.seq` package is available from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=iNEXT.seq) and can be downloaded with a standard R installation procedure or can be downloaded from Anne Chao's [iNEXT.seq_github](https://github.com/yayunteng/iNEXT.seq) using the following commands. For a first-time installation, an additional visualization extension package (`ggplot2`) must be installed and loaded. 


```{r eval=FALSE}
## install iNEXT.seq package from CRAN
install.packages("iNEXT.seq")
## install the latest version from github
install.packages('devtools')
library(devtools)
install_github('yayunteng/iNEXT.seq')
## import packages
library(iNEXT.seq)
```


Here are two main functions we provide in this package : 

- **iNEXTseq** : Computing dissimilarity estimates as UniFrac distances at specified sample coverage.

- **ggiNEXTseq** : Visualizing the output from the function `iNEXTseq`


## MAIN FUNCTION: iNEXTseq()

We first describe the main function `iNEXTseq()` with default arguments: 

```{r eval=FALSE}
iNEXTseq(data, q = c(0, 1, 2), level = NULL, nboot = 10, conf = 0.95,
             PDtree = NULL, PDreftime = NULL)
```


The arguments of this function are briefly described below, and will be explained in more details by illustrative examples in later text. This main function computes UniFrac distance estimates of order q at specified sample coverage. By default of <code>level = NULL</code>, then this function computes estimates up to one (for q = 1, 2) or up to the coverage of double the reference sample size (for q = 0).

(the corresponding diversity represents asymptotic diversity). \cr

This function returns an `"iNEXTseq"` object which can be further used to make plots 
using the function `ggiNEXTseq()` to be described below. 

## DATA FORMAT/INFORMATION
Data should be provided as Individual-based abundance data.

Input data for each region with several assemblages/sites include samples species abundances in an empirical sample of n individuals (â€œreference sample"). When there are N assemblages in a region, input data consist of a list with an S by N abundance matrix; For M regions consisting N assemblages, input data should be M lists of S by N abundance matrix.

A data set (a microbiome sample take from tongue dorsum and buccal mucosa) is included in `iNEXT.seq` package for illustration. The data consist a species-by-assemblages matrix with two assemblages (tongue and cheek).For the data, the following commands display how to compute UniFrac distance estimate at specified sample coverage.

Run the following code to view `tongue_cheek` OTU count data: (Here we only show the first ten rows for the matrix)

```{r eval=FALSE}
data("tongue_cheek")
tongue_cheek
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
data("tongue_cheek")
head(tongue_cheek, 10)
```

The `iNEXTseq()` function returns the `"iNEXTseq"` object including two data frames for each regions: 

- C (for UniFrac distance measured by Sorensen-type dissimilarity)
- U (for UniFrac distance measured by Jaccard-type dissimilarity)

## Rarefaction/Extrapolation Via Examples

Run the `iNEXTseq()` function with `tongue_cheek` data to compute UniFrac 
distance standardized by sample coverage. (Here we only show the first six rows for each output data frame)

```{r eval=FALSE}
data("tongue_cheek")
data("tongue_cheek_tree")

out = iNEXTseq(data = tongue_cheek, q = c(0, 1, 2), nboot = 10, 
                            PDtree = tongue_cheek_tree, PDreftime = NULL)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
out = iNEXTseq(data = tongue_cheek, q = c(0, 1, 2), nboot = 10, 
                            PDtree = tongue_cheek_tree, PDreftime = NULL)
lapply(out$Region_1, function(x) {
    tmp = x[1:6,]
    tmp[,c('Estimate', 'Size', 's.e.', 'LCL', 'UCL')] = round(tmp[,c('Estimate', 'Size', 's.e.', 'LCL', 'UCL')], 3)
    tmp
})
```

The output contains two data frames: `C` for Sorensen-type, `U` for Jaccard-type. For each data frame, it includes the UniFrac distance estimate (`Estimate`), the diversity order (`Order.q`), `Method` (Interpolated, Observed, or Extrapolated, depending on whether the size `m` is less than, equal to, or greater than the reference sample size), the sample coverage estimate (`SC`), the sample size (`Size`), the standard error from bootstrap replications (`s.e.`), the 95% lower and upper confidence limits of diversity (`LCL`, `UCL`), and the name of region (`Region`). These UniFrac distance estimates with confidence intervals are used for plotting the R/E curve.


## GRAPHIC DISPLAYS: FUNCTION ggiNEXTseq()

The function `ggiNEXTseq()`, which extends `ggplot2` to the `"iNEXTseq"` object with default arguments, is described as follows: 

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggiNEXTseq(output, scale = "fixed", transp = 0.4)  
```

<table style="width:100%;">
<colgroup>
<col width="20%">
<col width="80%">
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="center">Argument</th>
<th align="left">Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="center"><code>output</code></td>
<td align="left">the output of <code>iNEXTseq</code>.</td>

</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="center"><code>scale</code></td>
<td align="left">Are scales shared across all facets (the default, <code>"fixed"</code>), or do they vary across rows (<code>"free_x"</code>), columns (<code>"free_y"</code>), or both rows and columns (<code>"free"</code>)?</td>

</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="center"><code>transp</code></td>
<td align="left">a value between 0 and 1 controlling transparency. <code>transp = 0</code> is completely transparent, default is <code>0.4</code>.</td>

The `ggiNEXTseq()` function is a wrapper around the `ggplot2` package to create a R/E curve using a single line of code. The resulting object is of class `"ggplot"`, so it can be manipulated using the `ggplot2` tools.

```{r eval=FALSE}
out = iNEXTseq(data = tongue_cheek, q = c(0, 1, 2), nboot = 10, 
                   PDtree = tongue_cheek_tree, PDreftime = NULL)
ggiNEXTseq(out)
```

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.height=6, fig.width=6}
ggiNEXTseq(out)
```
